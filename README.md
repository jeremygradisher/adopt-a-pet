## Adopt a Pet!
In this project, you will have the opportunity to practice using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application. Specifically, you will be building a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the animals of a particular species and view the profiles of specific animals.

Currently, the app renders a HomePage component that fetches and displays all adoptable pets (you can view the code for this page in src/pages/home/index.js). We have also built a PetDetailsPage to display the details for a particular pet (src/pages/detail/index.js), but this component will not render until you create a route to display it.


add react-router-dom:
$ npm install --save react-router-dom@6

This turned out cool...
